## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Due to the fact that I am a newbie to coding and I had no exposure to Swift nor Xcode before, I proceeded with the common features for the tip calculator. I have to be honest to say that I was watching the demo gifs on the instruction page for multiple times to make sure I am not missing anything. Fortunately, I have the app in one hour and I am amazed! I find this app very practical and I actually want to launch in my iPhone so I can just pull it up when I am dining in a restaurant in the future! Furtheremore, I actually spent another three hours on approaching the bonuses. But, they are not turning out as I wish them to be like. Regardless, I am very interested in learning more about Swift and Xcode in the class, and hopefully I can have the potential features figured out!
